        <p className="text-muted">
          Ziro Music Festival began as a dream in 2012, brought to life by Anup Kutty and Bobby Hano.
          Despite rough roads, remote terrain, and financial hurdles in its early years, their passion and
          perseverance helped shape Ziro into a standout experience for music lovers and travelers alike.

          By 2018, it had evolved into a much-anticipated annual gathering, known for its incredible vibe and
          intimate setting among Arunachalâ€™s green hills. What started as a music festival has gradually grown
          into a cultural celebration. Today, it offers more than music with nature walks, butterfly trails,
          yoga sessions, and village explorations, making it family-friendly and immersive.
        </p>
        <p className="text-muted">
          In 2022, performances expanded to include tribal languages like Nyishi and Galo, alongside the launch
          of the Ziro Literary Festival, reflecting a deeper commitment to celebrating regional art and culture.
