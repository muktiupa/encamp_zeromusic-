              Ziro Music Festival is a four-day celebration of independent music set against
              the breathtaking backdrop of Ziro Valley in Arunachal Pradesh. First held in 2012,
              it has grown into one of India’s most iconic outdoor music festivals — not for its
              scale, but for its soul.

              Organized by the local Apatani tribe in collaboration with musicians and artists
              from around the country, ZFM is known for its eco-conscious ethos, non-commercial vibe,
              and strong sense of community. You’ll find no flashy sponsors or giant LED stages here —
              just great music, stunning landscapes, and an atmosphere that feels refreshingly real.
            </p>

              The festival showcases a mix of genres like indie rock, folk fusion, electronic, and
              experimental — performed by both emerging and established artists from across India and abroad.
