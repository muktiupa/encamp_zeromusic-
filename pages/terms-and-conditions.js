                                        embargo. If a Provider is prevented or delayed in the performance of any of its
                                        obligations to you by Force Majeure, that Platform Owner shall immediately give written

                                        The operation of the Providers’ obligations and the Terms of Use shall be suspended
                                        during the period in which the Force Majeure continues. Both you and the Platform
                                        Owner shall use their best efforts to avoid, overcome and offset the effects of any cause
                                        or potential cause of an event of Force Majeure. Upon cessation of the cause of the

                                        operative. However, a Force Majeure event will not relieve you or the Platform Owner of
                                        the obligations accrued prior to the occurrence of the Force Majeure.
