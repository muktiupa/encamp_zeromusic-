</p>
<h2 className="mt-5">General Information Disclosures</h2>
<p>
We may disclose personal information that we collect or you provide, as described in the
Policy: (a) to our subsidiaries and affiliates, which are entities under common ownership or control of ETPL; (b) to contractors, service providers and other third parties whom
we use to support our business and who are bound by contractual obligations to keep

databases are hosted by third party hosting services providers. We may share information
about you with these vendors only to enable them to perform their services.<br/>
We may share your information when we believe in good faith that such sharing is
reasonably necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding possible
illegal activities or to comply with legal process. We may also share your information to
investigate and address threats or potential threats to the physical safety of any person, to
investigate and address violations of the Policy or the Terms of Use <Link href="/terms-and-conditions">Terms and Conditions</Link>, or to investigate and address violations of the rights of third

such as subpoena, court order or government demand to comply with applicable law for
the time being in force. You understand that we may not be able to notify you of such
disclosure if we are not permitted to do so under applicable law for the time being in
force.</p>
<br/><br/>

<h2 className="mt-5">Precise Location Information and How to Opt Out</h2>
<p>
When you use one of our location-enabled services in the Platform (for example, when
you access the Platform from a device), we may collect and process information about
your device’s GPS location (including the latitude, longitude or altitude of your device)
and the time the location information is recorded to customize the services offered in the
Platform with location-based information and features (for example, to inform you about
experiences in your area). Some of these services require your personal data for the
feature to work and we may associate location data with your device ID and other
information we hold about you.<br/>
We keep this data for no longer than is reasonably necessary for providing services to
you. If you wish to use the particular feature, you will be asked to consent to your data
being used for this purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time by disabling the GPS or other location-tracking functions on your device, provided your device allows
you to do this.<br/>
In an effort to improve the Platform, we occasionally request that some Users and
recipients voluntarily complete surveys, which may be collected by an independent third
party. Individual survey responses are confidential, although non-personal information
may be collected and disclosed to third parties. If you do not wish to participate in a
survey, simply decline to participate when asked.
</p>
<br/><br/>
<h2 className="mt-5">Cookies, Clear Graphics Interchange Formats (“GIFs”) and Other Electronic
Tools</h2>
<p>
We, and third parties with whom we partner, may use standard technologies called
“cookies” and clear GIFs to collect information about how our Platform is used. A
cookie is a small data text file, that is stored on your device (if your web browser permits)
that enables us to recognize you (for example, as a registered user) when you visit our
Platform, store your preferences and settings, enhance your experience by delivering
content and advertising specific to your interests, perform research and analytics, track
your use of our services, and assist with security and administrative functions. Cookies
may be persistent or stored only during an individual session. Clear GIFs: Some of our
service providers may employ clear GIFs (also known as pixel tags, single pixel GIFs,
web beacons, device IDs, “flash cookies” or action tags) for our benefit to help us
measure advertising effectiveness. Clear GIFs help us better manage content on the
Platform by informing us of what content is effective. Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a
unique identifier, embedded invisibly on a webpage (or an online ad or Email), and is
used to count or track things like activity on a webpage or ad impressions or clicks, as
well as to access cookies stored on Users’ devices, similar in function to cookies, and are
used to track the online movements of our Users. The main difference between the two
is that clear GIFs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the
period at the end of this sentence.<br/>
Most browsers are set to automatically allow cookies. Please note it may be possible to
disable some (but not all) cookies through your device or browser settings, but doing so
may interfere with certain functionality on the services. Major browsers provide users
with various options when it comes to cookies. Users can usually set their browsers to
block all third party cookies (which are those set by third party companies collecting
information on websites operated by other companies), block all cookies (including first
party cookies such as the ones we use to collect search activity information about our
Users), or block specific cookies. To modify your cookie settings, please visit your
browser’s help settings. You will need to opt out on each browser and each device you
use to access the services. Flash cookies operate differently than browser cookies and
cannot be removed or blocked via web browser settings. By using our services with your
browser set to accept cookies you are consenting to our use of cookies.<br/>
Third parties whose products or services are accessible or advertised through the
services, including social media services, may also use cookies or similar tools, and we
advise you to check their privacy policies for information about their cookies and other practices. We do not control the practices of such partners and their privacy policies
govern their interactions with you.

We may also obtain information about you from third parties such as partners,
marketers, third-party websites, and researchers, and combine that information with
information which we collect from or about you.<br/><br/>
</p>
<h2 className="mt-5">Anonymous or De-Identified Data</h2>
<p>
We may anonymize and/or de-identify information collected from you through the
Platform or via other means, including via the use of third party web analytic tools as
described below. As a result, our use and disclosure of aggregated and/or de-identified
information is not restricted by the Policy, and it may be used and disclosed to others
without limitation.<br/><br/>
</p>
<h2 className="mt-5">Accessing and correcting your personal information</h2>
<p>
We will take reasonable steps to accurately record the personal information that you

limited, subject to the applicable law for the time being in force of your jurisdiction: (a) if
your requests are abusive or unreasonably excessive, (b) where the rights or safety of
another person or persons would be encroached upon; and/or (c) if the information or
material you request relates to existing or anticipated legal proceedings between you and
us, or providing access to you would prejudice negotiations between us or an
investigation of possible unlawful activity. Your right to review, update, correct, and
delete your information is subject to our records retention policies and applicable law for

</p>
<h2 className="mt-5">Information Security</h2>
<p>
We have implemented industry-standard appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial
procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access to your information and
to maintain data security.<br/>
These safeguards take into account the sensitivity of the information that we collect,
process and store and the current state of technology. We follow generally accepted
industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during
transmission and once we receive it.<br/>
We use the Secure Sockets Layer (“SSL”) technology. SSL encrypts your order
information as additional protection against the decoding of that information by anyone
other than us. However, despite all reasonable security precautions and processes, such
as password protection, encryption technology, and use of firewall technology, no data
transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. AS A RESULT,
WHILE WE STRIVE TO PROTECT YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE
INFORMATION, WE CANNOT GUARANTEE OR WARRANT THE SECURITY
OF ANY INFORMATION YOU TRANSMIT TO OR FROM THE PLATFORM
AND YOU DO SO AT YOUR OWN RISK. Once we receive your transmission, we
will take commercially reasonable precautions to protect its security on our systems.
Your password(s) will be your personal, secret entry code(s) to access your personal
account(s) on the Platform. In the event you have registered an account on the Platform
and when you access your account information, it is kept on a secure server and a
password is needed to access any account areas. You can change your password as many
times as you like. We recommend that you keep your password in a safe place and that
you always sign off your account and close your browser window once you have
completed your visit. These precautions will help prevent someone else from accessing
your account, especially if you share a device with other people or use a device in a public
place such as an Internet café or library.<br/>
We assume no liability or responsibility for disclosure of your information due to errors
in transmission, unauthorized third party access, or other causes beyond our control.
You play an important role in keeping your personal information secure. You should not
share your user name, password, or other security information for your account with
anyone. If we receive instructions using your user name and password, we will consider
that you have authorized the instructions.<br/>
In case you would like to know more about how we keep your information secure, please
reach out to us at 
support@encampadventures.com with your specific queries.<br/><br/>
